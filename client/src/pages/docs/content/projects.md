# Projects

Projects live inside organizations. Each project has its own members, roles, password policy, and project policy — which together control how end-users authenticate.

## Base URL

```
/api/v1/organizations/:orgId/projects
```

All project endpoints require authentication and at minimum an org-level membership.

## Project roles

Project members have their own role hierarchy, separate from org roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `manager` | Full project access — assigned automatically to the project creator |
| `contributor` | Can manage policies and end-users |
| `viewer` | Read-only access |

> Org-level `owner` and `admin` can always access project endpoints regardless of project membership.

## POST /

Create a new project inside an organization. Requires org-level `admin` or `owner`.

```http
POST /api/v1/organizations/:orgId/projects
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "name": "Mobile App",
  "description": "End-user auth for our mobile application"
}
```

### Response — 201 Created

```json
{
  "message": "Project created successfully",
  "project": {
    "_id": "664proj123def456789012",
    "name": "Mobile App",
    "description": "End-user auth for our mobile application",
    "orgId": "664abc123def456789012345",
    "createdBy": "664abc...",
    "createdAt": "2024-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The creator is automatically added as a `manager` member of the project.

## Setup checklist

Before end-users can authenticate against a project, complete these steps in order:

1. Create the project — `POST /api/v1/organizations/:orgId/projects`
2. Create a password policy — `POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/password-policy`
3. Create a project policy — `POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/policy`
4. End-users can now signup at — `POST /api/v1/project/:projectId/end-user/signup`

See [Policies](/docs/policies) for full policy configuration details.
